# Project for building mind maps from personal literature review.

The idea behind is in systematizing information derived from my PhD literature reviews in a user friendly way - with the mind maps. I reed articles and add them to the list of literature. Then, I build mind maps from it using R and Shiny app for on-line visualizing of these maps. 

Main sources of inspiration about creating mind maps in R came from:

* [Adeel Khan](https://adeelk93.github.io/post/17/3/28/collapsibleTree/)
* [This article](https://adeelk93.github.io/collapsibleTree/)
* [R package for building trees](https://github.com/AdeelK93/collapsibleTree)
